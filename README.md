# IT-Industry-Trends-Emerging-Skills-and-Innovations

The project aimed to solve a business challenge through data analysis of real-world datasets. The tasks carried out included :
- data collection from multiple sources, such as web scraping and the use of web APIs,
- data preparation, 
- exploratory data analysis,
- statistical analysis,
- data mining. 

 Results were visualized using various charts and plots, and an interactive dashboard was created using IBM Cognos Analytics. 
 The project concluded with a presentation of a comprehensive data analysis report, including an executive summary, analysis, and conclusion, to stakeholders within the organization.
 The data collected was analyzed to determine the distribution, presence of outliers, and correlations between different columns. 
 The visualizations highlighted the distribution, relationships, composition, and comparison of data. 
 The dashboard enabled the drill-down of data and provided an intuitive platform for analysis.
